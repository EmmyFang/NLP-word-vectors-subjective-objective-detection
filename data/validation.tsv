this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 	1
a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 	1
though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 	1
it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 	1
highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 	1
