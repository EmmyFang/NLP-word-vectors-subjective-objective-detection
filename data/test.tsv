a magnificent conjuring act , an eerie historical mirage evoked in a single sweeping wave of the hand by alexander sokurov . 	1
a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 	1

a delectable little treat that's sunny , funny , and far more intelligent than you'd expect . 	1
as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 	1
can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 	1
snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 	1
the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 	1
ong chooses to present ah na's life as a slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to melt away in the face of the character's blank-faced optimism . 	1

feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . 	1
it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 	1

ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 	1
just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 	1
thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun . 	1
i certainly found its depiction of a family affected by grief far more believable and effective than the strident dish-breaking , breast-beating of in the bedroom . 	1
a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 	1
an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 	1
hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 	1
nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 	1
true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 	1
like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 	1
after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 	1
no one , including the viewers , seems to know who can be trusted , and that's what makes this movie fun to watch . 	1
it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 	1
the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 	1
impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 	1
it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times . 	1
the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 	1
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 	1
a sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old welsh boy more curious about god than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter . 	1
the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 	1
canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 	1
too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 	1

fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 	1
steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 	1
an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great �what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances	1
human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem . 	1
that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 	1
while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 	1
the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 	1
this film is difficult to watch for the inhumanity it depicts , but important to see for its factual elements and the reminder of both the difficulty and importance of maintaining one's humanity . 	1
life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 	1
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 	1
pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 	1
the first hour alone is worth the admission price . 	1
"perry's good and his is an interesting character , but "" serving sara "" hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . "	1
a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 	1
a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 	1
claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 	1
the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 	1
what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 	1
it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 	1
being a sayles film , this has a way of looking at things with more patience and maturity than a plot summary might lead us to expect . 	1

for a movie audience , the hours doesn't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 	1
red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin . 	1
